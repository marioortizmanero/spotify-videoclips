==  Installation

Vidify ships with the most popular <<_the_apis,APIs>> for your operating system.
The music videos can be played on either <<_the_players,the same computer, or on
a different device>>.

Here are the different ways to install Vidify, depending on your Operating
System:

* *Cross-platform:* From https://pypi.org/project/vidify[PyPi]: `pip install
  --user vidify`.
* *Windows or Linux:* Using the binaries from the
  https://github.com/vidify/vidify/releases[latest stable releases]. These
  include support for all APIs available on your platform, and use mpv as the
  player.
* *Linux:*
+
--
** Arch Linux: you can install it from the AUR:
   https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vidify[`vidify`]. Maintained by me
   https://github.com/marioortizmanero[marioortizmanero].
** Gentoo Linux: there's an ebuild maintained by
   https://github.com/AndrewAmmerlaan[AndrewAmmerlaan] in the
   https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU[GURU overlay] at
   https://gpo.zugaina.org/media-video/vidify[media-video/vidify]: `eselect
   repository enable guru && emerge --sync guru && emerge vidify`
--
+
Feel free to upload Vidify to your distro's repositories! Let me know in an
issue so that I can add it to this list.

NOTE: Vidify requires Python >= 3.6.

=== The APIs

An _API_ is simply a source of information about the music playing on a device.
For example, the Spotify desktop client, or iTunes. Here are the currently
supported ones:

[cols="25%,10%,15%,50%"]
|===
|Name |Identifier |Wiki Link |Description

|Linux Media Players
|`mpris_linux`
|https://vidify.org/wiki/linux-media-players/[ðŸ”— vidify.org]
|Any MPRIS compatible media player for Linux or BSD (99% of them, like Spotify,
Clementine, VLC...).

|Spotify for Windows & MacOS
|`swspotify`
|https://vidify.org/wiki/spotify-for-windows-and-macos[ðŸ”— vidify.org]
|The Spotify desktop app for Windows & MacOS, using the
https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify[SwSpotify] library.

|Spotify Web
|`spotify_web`
|https://vidify.org/wiki/spotify-web-api/[ðŸ”— vidify.org]
|The official Spotify Web API, using
https://github.com/felix-hilden/tekore[Tekore]. Check the wiki for more details
on how to set it up.
|===

The identifier is used as a key for the <<_usage,arguments>> and the
<<_the_config_file,config file>> options. `vidify --api mpris_linux` would
forcefully use the Linux Media Players API, for instance. It's also used for the
extra dependencies installation with pip; the command `pip install
vidify[extra1]` would install all the extra requirements for `extra1` with pip.

=== The players

A _player_ determines where and how the video plays.

[cols="25%,10%,65%"]
|===
|Name |Identifier |Description

|Mpv
|`mpv`
|With this you can play the music videos inside the desktop app itself, thanks
to an embedded instance of https://mpv.io/[Mpv]

|External
|`external`
a|This lets you play Vidify's music videos essentially anywhere, like your TV.
It will send all the music video information from the desktop to an external
application. Currently the only application is the official one:

* *Vidify TV*: available on Android, Android TV and Amazon Fire Stick TV.
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glowapps.vidify[Play Store
  page].
|===

== Usage

The app has an interface that will guide you through most of the set-up, but you
can use command line arguments and the config file for more advanced options
(and until the GUI is completely finished):

----

== The config file

The configuration file is created by default at the usual directory:

* Linux: `~/.config/vidify/config.ini` (or in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if defined)
* Mac OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/vidify/config.ini`
* Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\vidify\vidify\config.ini`

https://github.com/vidify/vidify/blob/master/example.ini[Here's an example of
one]. It uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file[INI config file
formatting]. Most options are inside the `[Defaults]` section. You can use a
custom file by passing `--config-file <PATH>` as an argument.

All the available options for the config file are the same as the arguments
listed in the <<_usage,Usage section>>, except for `--config-file <PATH>`, which
is only an argument. Their names are the same but with underscores instead of
dashes. For example, `--use-mpv` would be equivalent to `use_mpv = true`.

NOTE: The options from the config file are overriden by the configuration passed
as arguments.

== FAQ

[qanda]
Vidify doesn't work correctly with Python 3.8 and PySide2::
  PySide2 started supporting Python 3.8 with the 5.14 release. Make sure you're
  using an updated version and try again. `TypeError: 'Shiboken.ObjectType'
  object is not iterable` will be raised otherwise.
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gi'` when using a virtual environment::
  For some reason, `python-gobject` may not be available inside a virtual
  environment. You can create a symlink inside it with:
+
[source,bash]
----
ln -s "/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/gi" "$venv_dir/lib/python3.8/site-packages"
----
+
or install it with pip following
https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html[this guide].
Vidify doesn't recognize some downloaded songs::
  If the song doesn't have a metadata field with its title and artist (the
  latter is optional), Vidify is unable to know what song is playing. Try to
  modify the metadata of your downloaded songs with VLC or any other tool.
Not playing any videos (`HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`)::
  If Vidify is not playing any videos, and is throwing 403 Forbidden errors
  (with the `--debug` argument). The YouTube-DL cache has likely become corrupt
  or needs to be regenerated because of other reasons, please try deleting
  `~/.cache/youtube-dl`.

== Development

=== Releases

The changelog and more information about this program's versions can be found in
the https://github.com/vidify/vidify/releases[GitHub Releases page].

=== External player implementations

The Vidify external player has an open protocol for anyone to implement their
own app or program to play the videos. You can read more about how it works in
this https://vidify.org/wiki/the-external-player-protocol/[wiki article].

=== Contributing

Any contributions to Vidify are welcome!

There should always be lots of https://github.com/vidify/vidify/issues[open
issues] in the GitHub repo. The easiest ones for newcomers are those tagged with
https://github.com/vidify/vidify/labels/good%20first%20issue["good first
issue"], but you can still try to tackle others. If you need help, leave a
comment and a maintainer will try to explain what needs to be done to do in
steps. When you open a PR with the implementation, ask for a review to get some
feedback on your work.

It's strongly recommended to join https://discord.gg/yfJSyPv[the official
Discord server] for discussion and help when developing.

You can run the module locally with `python -m vidify`. You will need all the
required Python dependencies installed with `pip install -e .`.

====  Project organization

Here's a brief description of the directories in this repository:

* `vidify`: source code for both the logic and GUI of Vidify, in Python
* `res`: resources Vidify uses, like fonts, icons, images...
* `dev`: some scripts and tools needed for developer tasks, like building
* `tests`: Python tests. See the <<_tests>> section for more
* `images`: some images used for the README and such

==== Style

Vidify tries to follow a consistent style by using automatic formatting tools:

* `black`, `isort` for formatting, and `flake8` for linting. Simply run them
  with `python -m <module>` at the root of the repo.

=== Tests

This project uses `unittest` for testing with Python. Run them with `python -m
unittest`. You'll need all the extra dependencies installed for this to work.

=== Building

Vidify is deployed with static binaries for ease of use and reproducibility.
This is fully automated with GitHub Actions; binaries will be generated when a
new version of Vidify is released.

If you want to manually try it out, you need to do is run the build script,
preferably inside the docker container:

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo docker build -t vidify .
$ sudo docker run -v $PWD:/vidify/ -t vidify ./build.sh
$ ls ./build/*.zip
./build/vidify-X.Y.Z_OS_ARCH.zip
----

If you find any problems, please
https://github.com/vidify/vidify/issues/new[open an issue].

==== Building Appx Package for Windows

You may build the package as an `.appx` application. You'll need
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/create-app-package-with-makeappx-tool[MakeAppX]
installed in your system. If it's available as a cmdlet, you can use the full
path `C:\"Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\App Certification
Kit\makeappx.exe"` (or wherever you've installed it).

[source, powershell]
----
$ python build.py
$ mv build dev/Vidify
$ cd dev
$ makeappx.exe pack /m .\appxmanifest.xml /f .\AppxMapping.ini /p AppxVidify
----

You can now use `AppxVidify.appx` to launch Vidify.
